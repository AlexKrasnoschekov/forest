// Cats are cute and effective predators who stalk their prey in this strange forest and like to talk about it.
// At the moment, they do not have much to talk about.
// You can change that.

// All cats in this strange dark forest seem to have the same face.
// I can say you more than that - they all have a one single face that they discontentedly share.
// When you look at a cat, through her personal creature face you actually see that single common muzzle.
// Cats are strange creatures.
